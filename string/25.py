Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we do search for a string in a notepad/word file, browser, or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results. A typical problem statement would be- 
Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1] where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern, write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m. 
Examples: 

Input:  txt[] = "THIS IS A TEST TEXT"
        pat[] = "TEST"
Output: Pattern found at index 10

Input:  txt[] =  "AABAACAADAABAABA"
        pat[] =  "AABA"
Output: Pattern found at index 0
        Pattern found at index 9
        Pattern found at index 12
