            {D,D,D,G,D,D},
            {B,B,D,E,B,S},
            {B,S,K,E,B,K},
            {D,D,D,D,D,E},
            {D,D,D,D,D,E},
            {D,D,D,D,D,G}
           }
        str= "GEEKS"
Output :2

Input : a = {
            {B,B,M,B,B,B},
            {C,B,A,B,B,B},
            {I,B,G,B,B,B},
            {G,B,I,B,B,B},
            {A,B,C,B,B,B},
            {M,C,I,G,A,M}
            }
