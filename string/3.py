# Print all the duplicates in the input string

# Write an efficient program to print all the duplicates and their counts in the input string 

# Method 1: Using hashing

# Algorithm: Let input string be “geeksforgeeks” 

# Construct character count array from the input string.
# count[‘e’] = 4 
# count[‘g’] = 2
# count[‘k’] = 2 
# ……
# Print all the indexes from the constructed array which have values greater than 1.

str='geeksforgeeks'
