Given string str we need to tell minimum characters to be added in front of the string to make string palindrome.

Examples: 

Input  : str = "ABC"
Output : 2
We can make above string palindrome as "CBABC"
by adding 'B' and 'C' at front.

Input  : str = "AACECAAAA";
Output : 2
We can make above string palindrome as AAAACECAAAA
by adding two A's at front of string.
